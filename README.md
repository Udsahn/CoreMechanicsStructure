# CoreMechanicsStructure

The core structure within MonoGame projects for development purposes.

While not including MonoGame within the program, this allows for rapid development without the need of dealing with MonoGame directly.

This prime advantage allows one to quickly write and test structure ideas to ensure that they're valid before deploying them within MonoGame.
